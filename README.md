## Description 
This public repository contains a patch for Rosetta permitting Rosetta to link Masala's Core library, and to make use of Masala plugin libraries loaded at runtime.

## Authors

Masala support for Rosetta was developed by Vikram K. Mulligan, a Research Scientist in the Center for Computational Biology, at the Flatiron Institute.  For questions, e-mail vmulligan@flatironinstitute.org.

In addition, the following individuals contributed to the development of the Masala patch for Rosetta:

- Noora Azadvari, a graduate student at the University of Oregon (eazadvar@uoregon.edu).
- Tristan Zaborniak, a graduate student at the University of Victoria (tristanz@uvic.ca).
- Qiyao Zhu, a Flatiron Research Fellow in the Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute (qzhu@flatironinstitute.org).
- S.M. Bargeen A. Turzo, a Flatiron Research Fellow in the Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute (bturzo@flatironinstitute.org).
- P. Douglas Renfrew, a Research Scientist in the Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute (pdrenfrew@flatironinstitute.org).

The Masala patch for Rosetta is maintained by the Biomolecular Design (BmD) Group in the Center for Computatonal Biology at the Flatiron Institute.  Vikram K. Mulligan and P. Douglas Renfrew co-head the BmD Group.
